# Emotion-Detection
Emotion Recognition is a common classification task. For instance, given a tweet,  you create a model to classify the tweet as being either positive or negative.  However, human emotions consist of myriad emotions and cannot be constrained  to just these three categories. On the contrary, most of the datasets available for  this purpose consist of only two polarities â€” positive, negative, and at times  neutral. These emotions are necessary to identify to solve problems related to  human understanding or response to a given circumstance such as feedback of  service or a product especially useful for tech companies, marketing agencies,  fashion brands, media organizations, and many others. So, we have 6 emotions  namely sadness, anger, love, surprise, fear, and joy. This project will help us  understand consumer perception.
